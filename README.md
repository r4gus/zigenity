Run `zigenity --help` for a list of options.

This application uses the same return codes and options as [zenity](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/zenity), including:
* `0` - Ok button was pressed
* `1` - Cancel button was pressed
* `5` - Timeout (this is only returned when using the `--timeout` option)
* `255` - Some other error (e.g., no dialog type has been selected)
